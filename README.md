# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Analyze all the rideshare data for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, from January to early May of 2019, help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

## Results
Using Matplotlib and the given dataset. We were able to create a final line chart showing that Urban cities have the most rides, drivers and total fare amount most likly due to shorter commutes.

## Summary
Rural cities have less drivers, rides and fare and they average the highest fare per ride and driver, which could be because of longer commutes. Suburban cities are mid-average.  It would be best to break this down further per city in each area to show how many more drivers are needed per city. This will help focus on the underserved neighborhoods in the Urban and Rural cities.

### Recommendations
1. Increase the number of drivers in the suburban and rural cities.
2. Reduce the fare price in the rural cities to decrease the $10.00 disparity from the Urban cities.
3. Offer cost saving incentives to the underserved cities customers to help increase ride requests.
